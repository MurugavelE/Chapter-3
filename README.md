# Chapter 3 - Ionic CSS Components and Navigation

## About this chapter

So far we have seen what Ionic is, where it fits in the big picture of mobile hybrid application development. We have also seen two ways of scaffolding an Ionic app: one using the Ionic CLI, and the other using generator-ionic. In this chapter, we will work with Ionic CSS components, the Ionic grid system, and the Ionic state router. We will look at the various components of Ionic, using which you can build apps that provide a good user experience.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
 * Ionic grid system
 * Various CSS components
 * Integrating Ionic CSS components with AngularJS
 * Ionic state router
